# Dinosaurdle
A spin on the classic NYT game Wordle

## How to play
Similarly to Wordle, you are given 6 chances to guess the word. As you try to guess, the "Dinosaur" will get chase closer and closer to reach you. In order to beat the dinosaur, you need to guess the word before it reaches you and you have to reach the finish line

## Points
You can obtain more points for the less guesses you take to guess the word. However, the dinosaur gets faster as you make more correct guesses, so you need to balance between guessing quickly and guessing correctly.
