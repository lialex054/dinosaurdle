                        Welcome to <font color="52a35e">DINOSAURDLE</font>! This is a Wordle like game which introduces time pressure where
                        you have to get points faster than the DINOSAUR >:D . On your board, a <font color="52a35e">GREEN</font> square 
                        indicates that the letter is correct and also in the correct place. A <font color="c89c44">YELLOW</font> square indicates 
                        that your letter is in the wrong place. An empty PURPLE square means that your letter doesn't exist in the word. <br>
                        As this is Wordle, you only get SIX tries for ONE word. If you run out of guesses, you instantly lose the game :O. <br>
                        As you can see, the lower keyboard works and also lights up as well to show what letters you have guessed :D. <br>
                        For every <font color="c89c44">YELLOW</font> box, you earn ONE point, and for every <font color="52a35e">GREEN</font> box, 
                        you earn TWO points. Everytime you get a word, the score will be multiplied based upon how many tries you needed, then it will 
                        get added to your score. The DINOSAUR will also get set back by 30 points each time. However, the DINOSAUR 
                        gets more points every 0.5 seconds for each win you have. <br>
                        First to 100 points win! Good luck out there and try your best to outrun the DINOSAUR in DINOSAURDLE!!!! <br>
